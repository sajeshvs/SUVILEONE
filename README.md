## Core Concepts Implemented

This project is a direct translation of a business plan into a functional website. Key concepts realized in the code include:

*   **Radical Transparency:** Evident in the "Why Us" section, the detailed modal pop-ups explaining services, and the clear, tiered pricing plans with no hidden information.
*   **Proactive Partnership:** The "Dubai Home Hacks" blog section and the educational content within modals position the company as a partner, not just a service provider.
*   **Tech-Driven Service:** The integration of a WhatsApp chat button and the conceptual framework for live job updates (as described in the "Why Us" section) reflect a modern, tech-forward approach.
*   **Human-Centric Branding:** The "Meet The Techs" section directly addresses the goal of humanizing the service and building trust by putting a face to the name.
